# Unix-Shell

This Repository consists of a Unix Shell programmed in C. By running child-based system calls, many common commands normally run in shells, like ls, for example, can be run. The file mush2.c contains all the relevant code and the MakeFile compiles a runnable version. This project, however, is run with the help of a program written by my professor which can only be accessed by my code while on the Cal Poly SLO Unix servers.
